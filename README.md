## 📋 Overview

This project analyzes Twitter data to classify sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) using machine learning. The implementation uses the **Naive Bayes** classifier and evaluates model performance through accuracy metrics.

## 📊 Approach

- **Algorithm**: Naive Bayes classifier
- **Task**: Sentiment classification from tweet text
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy-based performance metrics

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk
```

### Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook `Group Project (1)m.ipynb`
2. Ensure your dataset is loaded (or update the data path)
3. Run all cells to preprocess, train, and evaluate the model

## 📈 Results

The notebook includes:

- Data preprocessing and text cleaning
- Naive Bayes model training
- Accuracy evaluation and metrics
- Sentiment classification examples

For detailed methodology, analysis, and findings, refer to the [PDF report](_Assignment3_Team1_Report.pdf).
